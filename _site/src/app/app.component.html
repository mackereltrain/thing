        Thanks for actually opening the link! This whole thing is just a way for me to get everything off my chest, regardless of whether you read it or not, since I canâ€™t talk to you. 
        Getting over you has been kind of impossible for me since whenever I make any sort of progress towards doing so, the same thoughts keep pulling me back. I keep thinking that moving 
        on would confirm that I never really cared for you and if I just found the way to convey the way Iâ€™ve always felt towards you, Iâ€™d somehow be able to salvage whatever shit show I've 
        gotten myself into. And if I were to just move on, Iâ€™d always look back and hate myself for not trying more while I still could. And that has always been in the form of trying 
        to talk you. And since thatâ€™s definitely not happening, Iâ€™ll go for the next best thing and just put everything I have to say here and hope that you read it.

            This was just going to a Google Doc or something, but I felt like it wasn't enough. So since I'm extra af, I made a whole ass website. Do I think this is a good idea? Absolutely not.
            I know I'm crazy and an absolute clown for doing any of this, but atleast I can do things like
            <app-sidenote [text]="'click this pls'" 
                        [title]="'Blue Tag'"

            </app-sidenote>. Can I do that in Google Docs? Probably. But 
            I guess itâ€™s more of a symbolic thing for me since in order for me to move on, I think I just need to be able to look back and say that Iâ€™ve done all that I could have to clear things 
            up and that thereâ€™s literally nothing else that I could have done. And putting in a hundred hours over a few months into the

    <p>
        I know you arenâ€™t hung up over this, but I feel like a big reason for what got us in this situation was me not being clear about why I broke up with you. With how little I told you, 
        I donâ€™t blame you for assuming it was because I just wanted to get with someone that I met in college, didnâ€™t like you enough to go through with long distance, or just lost feelings
        for you. I kind of brought it up before, but it was really because at the time, I somehow convinced myself that you did not genuinely like me. And as happy as I was when I was around you, 
        this constant thought over the course of 2 years ate me inside.

I had the friend group of like Jason and Jeremy, but I had just started getting closer to them right around when I met you. Before that, I didn\'t even have people to eat lunch with. And when we started dating, I just started going to you every break so I never really got close to them. I just hung out with them whenever I felt like I was being to clingy by going over to you so often.'">
            </app-sidenote>. So when you ended up liking me back I was already thinking 
            <app-sidenote [text]="'?!?!?!?!?!?!?'"
                        [title]="'!?!?!?!?!?!?!'"

                        [info]="false">
            </app-sidenote>
            And because of how little I had going on for myself, you were literally everything to me. My whole life revolved around you. At school, any moment I could come see you, I would.
            After school, I'd only do school work, play games, and text you. Kind of weird given our current circumstances, but as a boyfriend, you can really see how much I enjoyed spending time with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            And this is where the doubts of you liking me started to come in. Everytime I would come to see you, I would always compare how excited I was, to how it appeared you were. For me, seeing
            you was always the highlight of my day. The pure joy I felt whenever I was around you, is something I'll never be able to explain. And on the contrast, whenever I came to you, it seemed like you
            were always more interested in whatever else you were doing or indifferent to whether I was there or not. And regardless of how you did feel when I was around, you can see how it looked
            like you weren't too happy to have me around. And whereas nowadays I'd be able to just shrug it off, a combination how frequently it happened, 
            <app-sidenote [text]="'others commmenting on it'"
                        [title]="'Others commmenting on it'"
                        [body]="'People would always comment on how whenever I came to you, I would cuddle you and you would kinda not care or just keep doing whatever you were doing. And I would just have to laugh it off and act like I wasn\'t dying inside ðŸ™‚ . And so when other people started pointing it out to me too, it was hard for me to brush those moments off'">
            </app-sidenote>, and my non-existent self confidence, made me slowly believe that you didn't really like me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And on top of that, our whole situation of never being able to see each other outside of school made everything worse. Because we never got to see each other outside of school,
            it made me that much more sad whenever I wouldn't see you being excited to see me. Like we never get to see each other and you'd still rather spend your time with your friends or
            whatever else you were doing. This didn't really make me angry. More sad that I didn't make you happy or just wasn't good or entertaining enough to warrant a shift in 
            your attention. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And when it came to going on dates, I grew increasingly frustrated with wanting to see you so badly, but never being able to. I'd always think maybe at our one month anniversary. Maybe at our 6 month. 
            And all the way to 2 years, we never got to a point where we could  consistently see each other outside of school. At first, I was fine with just blaming it on your strict parents, but with each 
            anniversary passing by, it became harder and harder. Just ignoring it and saying there's nothing you can do only lasts so long and the blame has to go somewhere.
            At around the year mark, I started to question whether it was really just your parents. I'd question whether you were really doing all that you could to get us more
            time together, further fueling the idea that you didn't really like me. And also I started to really doubt myself. At the year mark, it stopped being about your parents being strict, and
            more, they just don't like me. And honestly, I kind of see why. We already started off badly with that whole drumline Smash thing. And over the 2 years of us dating, I didn't talk to them
            a single time. And knowing that they didn't like me just reinforced how much I had already hated myself.

    <div class="subsection" id="Me Becoming Toxic">
        <div class="subheader"><h3>Me Becoming Toxic</h3></div>
            <p>
                At the beginning of my senior year, I really did start to fall apart. For pretty much the entire time we dated, the only thing I wanted in life, was to be able to spend more time
                with you. Every other second, my brain would be like. Wow. I really want to be with Stacy right now. But every time, it would be shut down since there was nothing we could do about 
                it. But over time, it started becoming we can't because I'm not good enough. Her parents just don't like me. She just doesn't like me. So any time I would think of you, which
                was literally always, I keep thinking that me not being good enough was the real reason for why we would never be able to see each other. 
                On top of that, it was college app season and that really made me realize how little I had going for me. So during that time, my self confidence was at an all time low and I
                regretfully ended up taking all that negative energy out on you.
            </p>
            <p>I started getting mad at the 
                <app-sidenote [text]="'stupidest things'"
                    [title]="'Oops'"
                    [body]="'Like passing out while we were texting or not responding fast enough. Like I did the same shit lol. Was mad about not being able to see you but couldn\'t get mad at you for that since it wasn\'t your fault. So I guess I ended up venting that anger out this way? Regardless, it was stupid.'">
                </app-sidenote>     
                and anytime I look back on those times, I just hate myself for treating someone I cared for like that. Especially the whole 
                <app-sidenote [text]="'Disney thing'"
                              [title]="'Disney'"
                              [body]="'AHHHHHHHHHHH. I HATE MYSELF FOR THIS. I just really wanted to on dates with you and Disney in my 17 year old head was the perfect date place. And so I was already in a shitty mood because my perfect date was being screwed by the SAT test thing and the whole delayed bus thing. And so I just ended up being big baby and taking it out on you. Sad. Sorry :c'">
                </app-sidenote>. But as terrible as I was during that time, I just hope that you don't hold that against me personally since I feel
                like it's clear that I'm not actually like that. I was just super self-conscious at the time and was always scared that you didn't like me and was taking anything you did as confirmation that you 
                didn't. And that whole toxic phase really only lasted for a few months out of the two years we dated. 
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection" id="Actually Breaking Up">
        <div class="subheader"><h3>Actually Breaking Up</h3></div>
        <p>
            During that whole toxic phase, I had already convinced myself that you didn't like me. But once 2nd semester of my senior year came around, I started getting better. I don't know if it was because 
            of not having college apps or not having to try in school, but the doubts I had didn't come up nearly as often. They would occasionally, but I was just so happy and stress free around you
            that I could just ignore them. And so at the time, I was committed to doing long distance with you. And when school ended, I remember how sad you looked when I left school for the last 
            time. And with that vision of you as my final interaction with you, I was ready to do long distance even though I knew I wouldn't be able to see you pretty much ever. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            But that all changed when we met one more time before I left for SLO. I didn't really ever tell you about this, but that one interaction was a big reason for me eventually breaking 
            up with you. It had already been a few months 
            since I had seen you and the last time I would before going off to college so it was kind of sentimental to me. And for pretty much the whole time, you were on your phone. And regardless 
            or how you actually felt at that time, you can see how that would make me start to doubt your interest in me. Like this is the last time we get to spend time with each 
            other and this is how you choose to spend it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And so off to college I went. With that whole experience as my last memory of you. And so every time I thought of you, which again was a lot, I would think about how that one interaction 
            proved that you didn't like me. And it was back to the same self-depricating thoughts of me not being good enough for you. And whereas usually I'd have you there with me at school
            to put those thoughts down, all I had was that final memory of you. After a few months of this, I came to the conclusion that you didn't genuinely like me. That you only thought you
            liked me because I was your first boyfriend and eventually, you would 
            <app-sidenote [text]="'realize that you didn\'t really like me'"
                              [title]="'pls no'"
                              [body]="'lmao I could have been right the whole time and you could\'ve just told me so I didn\'t have to clown myself thinking that you actually did and saved me 2 years of depression'"
                              [info]="false">
            </app-sidenote>. Beause I knew that I genuinely liked you, and the pure joy I always had
            when I was around you, I rarely saw in you. And because of how little self-confidence I had, this made sense to me. Like there's no way someone that amazing would actually like me so 
            therefore it can't be true. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And because of all these thoughts of me not being good enough for you, I just started hating myself. Like the frustration I would have from not being able to see you, and knowing that
            I wasn't good enough had me harming myself. And everyday, I would just be frustrated and mad at myself that I couldn't be what I thought you deserved. And after months of this, I couldn't 
            take it anymore. I was consistently 
            <app-sidenote [text]="'punching walls to the point where my hands would get bruised'"
                              [title]="'i no violent i swear'"
                              [body]="'Not an anger thing. Have you ever seen me visibly angry lol. Was a frustration/self hatred thing.'">
            </app-sidenote>. Like why am I going through so much suffering for someone that will eventually lose 
            feelings for me. And I then eventually convinced myself that I had to breakup with you. Even in the slim chance that you really did like me, that whole situation was just so detrimental
            to me both physically and mentally. So I did it and broke up with you. But how do you tell someone you care about that you're depressed and hurting yourself because of them. I'm already 
            bad at telling people how I feel so I just said it was because of long distance. In my head, I had already told you that I had concerns of you not liking me, and for it to still be 
            happening, there was no point of bringing it up again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So there you have it. That was why. There has never been a point in the past 5 years where I'd ever lost feelings for you. I didn't do it to just date someone else. And if had just
            been able to convince myself that you really did like me, there's no doubt I would've been able to do long distance with you. But sadly, I couldn't. So I really just self sabotaged myself 
            into ruining a perfectly fine relationship with the girl of my dreams all because I was unbelievably insecure. Fuck.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Post-Breakup">
    <div class="header"><h1>Post-Breakup</h1></div>
    <p>
        As much as I hate having lost you, it's hard to say that I regret breaking up with you. Distancing myself from you for a little allowed me to grow so much as a person. While we
        we were dating, everyday away from you was filled with me telling myself I was trash. And leaving that behind really had a great impact on every aspect of my life. Just
        being more confident in who I was as a person and not being sad boi 24/7 allowed me to make so many friends and grow as a person. And I really don't think that I'd been able to accomplish all that I have
        if hadn't taken time away from you. And so it's hard regretting my decision knowing that if I didn't, I would have just continued to be toxic towards you and not become the 
        person that I am today. Ever since breaking up with you, literally everything in my life has been going perfectly. Whether all that personal growth was worth it really depends on
        if I end up losing you forever.

    <div class="subsection" id="Not Talking to You">
        <div class="subheader"><h3>Not Talking to You</h3></div>
        <p>
            After breaking up with you, I really didn't know how to act. You were the only person I talked to so what was I supposed to do? I thought it would be weird if you continued
            to be the only person I texted. And when I did text you, I would just be reminded of the fact that I wasn't good enough for you and just be sad. So I ended up just not 
            talking to you. And I can see how it seemed like I cut you off since I stopped talking to you, but I just don't text in general. You were just the exception since we 
            were dating and I wanted to spend time with you since we couldn't meet up in person.

        <div class="subheader"><h3>Dating Someone Else</h3></div>
        <p>
            Yeah so this happened. I definitely didn't break up with you to get with them. I was too busy being sad boi before we broke up to really socialize with anyone. 
            Am I proud of this? Definitely not, but it happened. I was immature and trying to get over you. Big regret.

            When you asked me to hangout over the summer, I was super confused. I was so used to telling myself you didn't really like me. So why would you be asking me to hang out?
            After months of avoiding thinking of you, I started reflecting on our relationship and why we broke up. I remembered how happy I was when I was with you. Then also how
            deeply depressed I was. And all of these emotions rushing back to me just confused me. I didn't know how I was supposed to be feeling. After meeting
            up with you, it was clear to me that I still had feelings for you, but I went through some rough times when I was away from you and I was scared of going through that again.
